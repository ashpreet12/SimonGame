# SimonGame

In this project I tried to make A web version of the age-old memory game Simon. One must remember and repeat a series of button presses, while the steps increase with each level. 

###Technologies Used:
*HTML           (for elements and content of the page)
*CSS            (for styling the webpage)
*Bootstrap      (for layout and styling)
*JavaScript     (Main Core of the project. All the functionality to the game is provided with it.)
*Jquery         (for adding flash effect to the Game elements)
